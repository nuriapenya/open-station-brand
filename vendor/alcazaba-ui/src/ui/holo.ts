/**
 * os-ui — the holographic layer.
 *
 * The brand ships five mesh gradients and one instruction about them:
 * *"meshes reserved for hero surfaces."* This module is how a control
 * gets to be one, without every component reinventing what
 * "holographic" means and drifting from the others.
 *
 * ## What holographic means here
 *
 * Not a skin. A **moment**. A control paints the mesh when it is on,
 * selected, primary or filled — the one instant it speaks for the
 * brand — and wears ordinary Obsidian the rest of the time. A panel
 * where every surface is iridescent has no identity moments left to
 * spend, which is the failure mode this module is shaped to avoid.
 *
 * Three surface treatments, in ascending loudness:
 *
 * 1. **Edge** ({@link holoEdge}) — an iridescent hairline around an
 *    otherwise ordinary control. Costs nothing at rest, lights up on
 *    hover and focus. This is the one most controls get.
 * 2. **Sheen** ({@link holoSheen}) — a 10%-alpha film of the mesh's
 *    own hues laid over the existing surface. The hover state for
 *    something that is not yet lit.
 * 3. **Fill** ({@link holoFill}) — the mesh itself, at full strength,
 *    with Void ink on top. Reserved for the on/selected/primary state.
 *
 * …and four motions, which are what make the surfaces read as foil
 * rather than as paint:
 *
 * - **Glint** ({@link holoGlint}) — a specular band crossing once on
 *   hover. The single most "holographic" thing here.
 * - **Ring** ({@link holoRing}) — a press response that expands and
 *   fades, so a click reads as received before its result paints.
 * - **Shimmer** ({@link holoShimmer}) — the mesh travelling, for waits
 *   of unknown length.
 * - **Enter** ({@link holoEnter}) — scale-and-fade arrival for menus,
 *   toasts and dialogs.
 *
 * Every one of them stops under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and the
 * timings all come from `--os-ui-motion-*` / `--os-ui-ease-*` so a
 * panel of controls moves as one surface.
 *
 * ## Why the mesh is a gradient stack and not an SVG
 *
 * `background-position` can slide a gradient. That slide *is* the
 * holographic effect — a foil card shifting hue as you tilt it — and
 * it is why {@link holoFill} oversizes the mesh to 220% and moves it
 * under the pointer. A `url()` to the brand's SVG could not do that,
 * would rasterise one flat corner of a 1440×960 artboard onto a 44 px
 * switch track, and would cost a request. The meshes are transcribed
 * stop-for-stop into `--os-mesh-*` in `assets/css/variables.css`.
 *
 * ## The alias discipline
 *
 * Every fragment here reads its public token into a private `--_holo-*`
 * alias on `:host`, never declaring the public name. A custom property
 * declared on `:host` matches the host ELEMENT and beats anything the
 * element would INHERIT — so declaring `--os-ui-holo-fill` there would
 * make the palette's and every desktop theme's declaration of that name
 * dead on arrival. See `AGENTS.md`, "Never declare a themeable token on
 * a component's `:host`", and its guard in
 * `tests/vitest/component-token-reachability.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## Using it
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { css } from '../../core';
 * import { holoTokens, holoEdge, holoFill } from '../../holo';
 *
 * export const styles = css`
 *   ${ holoTokens }
 *   ${ holoEdge }
 *   ${ holoFill }
 *   button { ... }
 *   button:focus-visible { box-shadow: var( --_holo-focus ); }
 * `;
 * ```
 *
 * `holoTokens` is a prerequisite for the others — it declares the
 * aliases they read. Include it once per component.
 */

import { css } from './core';

/**
 * Fallback Holomesh, for the moment `variables.css` has not loaded.
 *
 * Three stops rather than the nine-layer transcription: this is a
 * floor, not the artwork, and it is inlined into every component that
 * takes a holographic fill. The full mesh is one declaration away in
 * `--os-mesh-holo`; what matters here is that a control with no
 * stylesheet is still recognisably lit rather than transparent.

/**
 * ## A note on the pseudo-element budget

 * An element has exactly two of these to spend, and this module wants

 * takes `::after`, which is already the whole budget for a control
 * wearing both — as `<os-button>` does.
 *
 * So the two motion fragments below are **element-based** instead: the
 * component stamps a `<span>` and the fragment styles it. That costs
 * one node and buys free composition — a button can carry the film,
 * the hairline, the glint and the press ring at once, and no future
 * fragment has to negotiate for a pseudo that is already taken.
 *
 * Both are driven from the PARENT's state via the child combinator
 * (`:active > .os-holo-ring`). The combinator is load-bearing: `:active`
 * matches an activated element *and every ancestor of it*, so
 * `:active .os-holo-ring` would fire every ring on the page the moment

/**
 * Field chrome — the interaction layer every text-like control shares.
 *
 * Bare element selectors, which would be reckless in a global
 * stylesheet and are exactly right inside a shadow root: the only
 * `input`, `select` or `textarea` this can reach is the component's
 * own. That is what lets one fragment give the whole form family a
 * single hover, a single focus ring and a single transition duration
 * without every component re-deciding them.
 *
 * It deliberately sets no padding, radius, background or font. Those
 * are each component's own shape — a `<os-textarea>` is not a
 * `<os-select>` — and a shared fragment that reached for them would
 * turn every future tweak into a negotiation.
 *
 * Checkboxes and radios are excluded throughout: they are painted by
 * {@link holoCheck}, which gives them the target ring rather than the
 * field one, and a hover that moves their border instead of their
 * background.
 *
 * ## Why the exclusions are wrapped in `:where()`
 *
 * `:not()` carries the specificity of its argument, so the honest
 * spelling — `input:not([type='checkbox']):not([type='radio']):focus`
 * — weighs (0,3,1). That is heavier than
 * `input[aria-invalid='true']:focus` at (0,2,1), which means a shared
 * fragment would quietly outrank every component's own error ring and
 * an invalid field would focus in Pulse instead of red. `:where()`
 * contributes nothing, so the same selector lands at (0,1,1) and every
 * component keeps the last word about its own states.

/**
 * The checkbox and radio paint.
 *
 * Shared because two components already draw this box —
 * `<os-checkbox>` and `<os-checkbox-label>` — and every picker in the
 * kit that grows a multi-select row will draw a third. One fragment
 * means the tick is the same tick everywhere.
 *
 * ## Why `accent-color` had to go
 *
 * `accent-color` is the right answer for a native checkbox and the
 * wrong one here: it takes a *colour*, and the checked state in this
 * kit is a *mesh*. There is no way to hand a gradient to the native
 * control, so the box is repainted from scratch — `appearance: none`,
 * a border, the mesh as a background, and the tick drawn as two
 * borders of a rotated box.
 *
 * The tick is CSS rather than an inline SVG on purpose: it inherits
 * `--_holo-ink`, so it stays Void on the mesh and follows a theme that
 * re-points the ink without anyone having to re-encode a data URI.
 *
 * `:indeterminate` is styled too, even though no component in the kit
 * sets it yet — it is one line, it is what a "select all" header
 * checkbox will need, and an unstyled indeterminate box under
 * `appearance: none` renders as an empty one, which is a silent lie
 * about the state.
