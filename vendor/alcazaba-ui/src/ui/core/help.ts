/**
 * os-ui — in-product component help descriptors.
 *
 * Every `<os-*>` component may declare a `static help: OsHelp`
 * descriptor on its class. Those descriptors power the Help tab in
 * OS Settings (developer-facing, admin-gated) so plugin authors can
 * browse the component library without leaving WordPress.
 *
 * Keeping help metadata on the class — rather than in a separate
 * docs file — means:
 *
 *   - It ships with the component at runtime (no build step).
 *   - It is type-checked against the real component.
 *   - It cannot drift silently: renaming a prop forces a descriptor
 *     update if the help table asserts on it.
 *
 * Components without a descriptor still appear in the Help tab with
 * a fallback rendering built from `static props`; the descriptor is
 * how authors enrich that baseline.

	 * Half the kit takes its data through a JS **property** rather
	 * than an attribute — `segments`, `data`, `columns`, `entries`,
	 * `items`, `ratings`. Those components cannot be populated from
	 * markup at all, so their examples rendered as an empty shell:
	 * a table with no rows, a log with no lines, a breadcrumb with no
	 * crumbs. This is the hook that fills them in.
	 *
	 * `root` is the example's own container, so a lookup is scoped to
	 * this example rather than to the document — the panel renders one
	 * example at a time, but a `document.getElementById()` in a shared
	 * settings window is a collision waiting for the second one.
	 *
	 * ```ts
	 * example: html`<os-crumb-chain removable></os-crumb-chain>`,
	 * exampleInit: ( root ) => {
	 *   const chain = root.querySelector( 'os-crumb-chain' );
	 *   if ( chain ) {
	 *     ( chain as OsCrumbChain ).segments = [ … ];
	 *   }
	 * },
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Must be **idempotent**: the panel repaints on every keystroke in
	 * the filter box, and re-runs this each time against the same
	 * nodes. Assigning properties is naturally safe; appending
	 * children or adding listeners is not.
