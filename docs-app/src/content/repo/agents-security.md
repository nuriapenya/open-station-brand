# Agents security model

Agents are the only part of OpenStation that **acts with capability on
a user's behalf**. Everything else in the framework renders, routes, or
stores. An agent creates posts, edits media, and changes site state,
driven by a language model reading text it did not write.

This document is the trust model. Read it before you register an
ability agents can call, add a trigger intake, or widen any of the
gates in [hooks-reference.md](./hooks-reference.md#ai-agents).

## The one-sentence version

**An agent must never do on your behalf what you could not do
yourself**, and anything an agent *reads* is untrusted input.

## The four boundaries

### 1. Agents cannot authenticate

An agent is a real `wp_users` row, so capability checks, edit locks,
comment attribution, and the audit trail work without a parallel ACL.
The row is synthetic only in that no credential may ever resolve to it.

`includes/agents/guard.php` blocks two distinct halves of WordPress:

| Path | Block |
|---|---|
| wp-login.php, XML-RPC, application passwords | `authenticate` @ 30 |
| Auth cookies, JWT / SSO / magic-link plugins | `determine_current_user` @ `PHP_INT_MAX` |
| Password reset | `allow_password_reset` |
| Application password creation | `wp_is_application_passwords_available_for_user` |
| `/?author=N` enumeration | `pre_get_posts` → 404 on the front end |

The `determine_current_user` guard is the one that matters, and it is
easy to leave out. **The `authenticate` chain never runs for cookie
validation** — a third-party plugin calling
`wp_set_auth_cookie( $agent_id )` (social login, passwordless login, a
"log in as user" admin tool) would hand out a live agent session with
no credential involved at all. The session guard is the catch-all
because every authenticated request funnels through it.

It does not interfere with the runner: `wp_set_current_user()` sets the
global directly and never re-runs the filter.

**guard.php loads unconditionally**, ahead of the `agents` feature
flag. Turning the feature off does not delete the agent rows, and rows
whose blocks unloaded with the feature would start accepting
application passwords again. If you move code in this module, keep the
blocks out of the flag.

### 2. A run is ceilinged at the invoker's capabilities

The runner switches the current user to the agent for the whole tool
loop, so each ability's `permission_callback` evaluates against the
agent's role. That is an intentional privilege change, so it is bounded
on both sides: a `user_has_cap` filter installed alongside the switch
turns off every primitive capability the invoker does not hold.

Without it the module is a textbook confused deputy:

- invoking is gated on `edit_posts` (contributor level),
- agents may hold `administrator`,
- so a contributor could ask an editor-role agent to publish, and the
  agent's own `permission_callback` would happily allow it.

Intersecting **primitive** caps is the correct level: `user_has_cap`
fires after `map_meta_cap()` has resolved `edit_post` into the
primitive that specific post actually needs, so object-level ownership
still resolves per-user and the intersection only removes reach the
invoker never had. It can never grant anything — an admin invoking a
contributor-role agent still gets contributor reach.

The ceiling is skipped only when there is no invoker (`$invoker_id` 0 —
a hook or cron-driven run), because intersecting with the logged-out
cap set would leave the agent unable to act at all. **A system-context
run therefore executes with the agent's full role.** If you add a
trigger intake that runs without a human, that is the decision you are
making; `openstation_agent_restrict_to_invoker` is where you change
it.

New trigger intakes must pass `$context['invoker']` when a human is
behind the run. It defaults to `get_current_user_id()`, which is
correct for a REST request and wrong for a deferred job.

### 3. Tool output is untrusted input

The AI Copilot solves prompt injection structurally: it only ever
offers the model read-only abilities, so a poisoned tool result can at
worst mislead an answer. **Agents deliberately hold mutating
abilities**, so that structural defence is unavailable here.

A tool result can carry text authored by someone far less privileged
than the invoker — a comment body, a contributor's draft, an uploaded
file's metadata. The runner therefore wraps every result in an
`<untrusted-tool-output>` fence (with any occurrence of the delimiter
inside the payload neutralized first, so content cannot close the fence
early) and the system prompt instructs the model to treat everything
inside as data.

**Treat this as mitigation, not a guarantee.** It is the third layer,
behind the invoker cap ceiling and each ability's own
`permission_callback`. Do not let it be the reason a mutating ability
is considered safe. When an ability returns fields the model has no
business seeing, strip them in
[`openstation_agent_tool_result`](./hooks-reference.md#openstation_agent_tool_result--experimental-filter).

### 4. Granting a role is granting capability

An agent acts with its role's capabilities, so minting one is a
promotion and is gated like one: `promote_users`, plus a genuine
administrator (super admin on multisite) for the `administrator` role.

`get_editable_roles()` is **not** sufficient on its own, despite the
name. Core implements it as a bare
`apply_filters( 'editable_roles', wp_roles()->roles )` with no
reference to the current user, so on a stock install it excludes
nothing. It is a useful constraint because plugins like WooCommerce
filter it, but the real gate is
`openstation_agent_actor_can_assign_role()`. The scenario it closes:
a role plugin hands `edit_users` to a shop-manager-shaped role, which
mints an administrator agent, which then acts with capabilities its
creator never had.

## Rate limits

Two independent buckets, both hourly:

- **Per agent** (`openstation_agent_default_rate_limit`, default 60,
  overridable per agent) — bounds one agent.
- **Per invoker** (`openstation_agent_invoker_rate_limit`, default
  120) — bounds one person across every agent on the site.

The second exists because the first does not stop a single `edit_posts`
user walking every agent in turn and spending the AI budget N times
over.

## Checklist for new work

Registering an ability agents can call:

- [ ] Does its `permission_callback` check a capability for the
      **specific object**, not just a blanket `edit_posts`?
- [ ] Would a contributor invoking it through an admin-role agent get
      more than they should? (If the ceiling is doing all the work,
      say so in the ability's description.)
- [ ] Does it return fields that should be stripped in
      `openstation_agent_tool_result`?
- [ ] Is `meta.annotations.readonly` set honestly? The Copilot's
      server-dispatched tool loop uses it as a security boundary.
- [ ] Does the `description` state every fact the model needs to use
      the result safely? It is the ONLY place such a fact reaches every
      caller: abilities are offered as native function declarations, so
      the description is in context whether or not any agent's prompt
      mentions the tool. `desktop-mode/get-post` saying its `content` is
      raw stored markup is the worked example — an agent told only by
      its own instructions leaves every other agent guessing, and a
      cautious one stops rather than risk writing rendered HTML back.

Adding a trigger intake:

- [ ] Call `openstation_agent_user_can_invoke_agent()` before
      `openstation_agent_invoke()`.
- [ ] Pass `$context['invoker']` when a human is behind the run.
- [ ] If it runs without a human, confirm the agent's full role is an
      acceptable ceiling for a message you do not control.

Touching guard.php:

- [ ] Keep it out of the `agents` feature flag.
- [ ] Keep both the `authenticate` and `determine_current_user` halves.
      They cover different things and neither is redundant.

## Tests

`tests/phpunit/tests/agentsSecurity.php` asserts each boundary above as
a property rather than as behavior. If you change anything in this
document, that suite should change with it.
