# Bridge protocol — wiring overview

A single page that maps every layer of the cross-window connection bridge end-to-end. You shouldn't need this to build a plugin — the public APIs in [`javascript-reference.md`](./javascript-reference.md) are sufficient. Read this when you're debugging a stuck handshake, building unusual integrations (cross-origin frames, custom transports), or contributing to the shell itself.

## Message types

Two protocol families flow over the same `postMessage` boundary:

- **Window-self channel** (`os-window-*`) — the unified [`Window.send/on`](./javascript-reference.md#windowsend-channel-payload---stable) API. The first thing most plugin code reaches for. Single channel, no handshake, scoped to one window's content.
- **Connection bridge** (`os-bridge-*`) — multi-connection peer-to-peer with handshakes, used by `wp.os.connect()` / `wp.os.iframe.requestConnection()`.

Both sides validate `event.origin` against `window.location.origin` (or the iframe URL's resolved origin for `iframeContent` synthesised iframes); messages without a recognized prefix are dropped.

### Window-self channel — `os-window-*`

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-window-send` | parent → iframe | `{ channel, payload }` | Posted by `Window.send( channel, payload )`. The iframe-side bridge fires every `wp.os.on( channel, cb )` subscriber. |
| `os-window-publish` | iframe → parent | `{ channel, payload }` | Posted by `wp.os.send( channel, payload )` inside the iframe. The parent forwards to every `Window.on( channel, cb )` subscriber for this window. |

Native (non-iframe) windows skip postMessage entirely — `Window.send` and the render's `windowApi.send` reach the parent / native channel-bus registries directly. Plugin authors don't need to know the window's render strategy; the framework picks the right delivery path.

### Content-identity announcement — `os-content-identity`

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-content-identity` | iframe → parent | `{ identity: WindowContentRef \| null }` | Which object this admin page shows — `{ type, id, label?, root?, links?, related? }`, resolved server-side in real admin context (post/page/CPT editors are roots and carry their content's internal hyperlinks as `links`; comment-edit and attached-media screens arrive pre-rooted at their parent post; the `openstation_window_content_identity` PHP filter extends detection). `related` carries the ready-to-open navigation targets behind the title bar's "Related" button — `{ id, group, label, url, groupLabel?, icon?, count? }` entries built for posts/pages and filterable via `openstation_window_related_entities`. Feeds `wp.os.relations` and the window-link visuals. |

Emitted on **every** chromeless page load, **including `identity: null`** — a full-page navigation away from an identified screen must clear the stale identity, and since every iframe navigation re-runs `admin_footer`, that same emission doubles as the re-announce-on-navigate path. It fires at the very TOP of the bridge script (right after the top-frame escape hatch, before any feature block) so a page-specific runtime failure elsewhere in the bridge can never cost the shell its window relations — unlike `os-ready`, which intentionally posts last.

**Re-announced after block-editor saves**: Gutenberg saves over REST without navigating, so the bridge also watches the `core/editor` save lifecycle and, after every real (non-autosave) save, refetches a server-recomputed identity from `GET /desktop-mode/v1/content-identity?post={id}` (capability-gated to `edit_post`; both identity filters run there with `$screen = null`) and posts this same message again. The parent engine diffs repeats, so identical re-announcements are free. See [`docs/examples/window-links.md`](./examples/window-links.md).

**Save broadcast**: on the same save-success edge the watcher also posts an upstream `{ type: 'os-broadcast', topic: 'os.<postType>.changed', payload: { source: 'editor', action: 'created' | 'updated', ids: [ postId ] } }` to the parent, which fans it out to every window — list windows showing that type refresh instantly. `action` is `'created'` exactly when the post was still new on the tick the save started. This is the block editor's leg of the content-change realtime layer (`includes/content-changes.php`); form-POST → redirect flows are covered server-side by the chromeless-footer emitter instead. The iframe-side consumer is the soft-reload handler: `edit.php` / `upload.php` / `edit-comments.php` are matched generically by list type, and non-standard list screens (the HPOS `wc-orders` list) are declared via the PHP-printed `/*__OPENSTATION_SOFT_RELOAD_EXTRAS__*/` placeholder, filterable server-side through `openstation_soft_reload_rules`.

### Connection bridge — `os-bridge-*`

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-bridge-handshake` | parent → iframe | `{ connectionId, targetWindowId, topics }` | Open a new connection. Iframe must ack before parent flushes its message queue. The `targetWindowId` is the host window's id — the iframe stores it for `wp.os.iframe.windowId` / `whenWindowId()`. |
| `os-bridge-handshake-ack` | iframe → parent | `{ connectionId }` | Iframe acknowledges. Parent fires `HOOKS.CONNECTION_OPENED` + flushes. |
| `os-bridge-publish` | both ways | `{ connectionId, topic, payload }` | Pub/sub message. Wildcard subscribers (`'*'`) see every topic. |
| `os-bridge-disconnect` | both ways | `{ connectionId }` | Tear the connection down. Idempotent. |
| `os-bridge-connection-request` | iframe → parent | `{ requestId, topics }` | `wp.os.iframe.requestConnection()`. Parent fires `HOOKS.IFRAME_CONNECTION_REQUEST` filter; default accept. |
| `os-bridge-connection-ack` | parent → iframe | `{ requestId, accepted, connectionId? \| reason? }` | Reply to a request — accepts hand back the new connection id, rejects supply a reason. |

When the connection bridge targets a **native** window, no postMessages are exchanged — `connect()` opens synchronously and `conn.send/subscribe` route through the same in-process channel bus that powers `Window.send/on`. Same `onOpen` / `isOpen` / `disconnect` semantics, no observable difference to the caller.

### OS-file drop forwarder — `os-file-drop`

When the user drags a file from the host operating system onto a chromeless admin iframe, the chromeless bridge (and the standalone iframe bridge) intercepts the `drop` event before the browser's default handler navigates the iframe, and forwards the raw `File[]` to the parent shell.

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-file-drop` | iframe → parent | `{ files: File[], x: number, y: number }` | Native-OS file drop captured inside the iframe. Same-origin only — `postMessage` preserves `File` identity. The parent's `OsFileDropManager` resolves the source iframe's `data-window-id` via `MessageEvent.source` and routes the files through the drop pipeline. |

The forwarder listens in **bubble phase** at the iframe's `document`, so any in-page drop receiver runs first and gets the chance to claim the drop. Two bail conditions, in order:

1. **Curated allowlist** — `.components-drop-zone`, `[data-drop-zone]`, `.uploader-window`, `.media-frame-content` always yield, so Gutenberg's media uploader and the legacy media library keep working as before even on edge cases that skip the spec dance.
2. **`event.defaultPrevented === true`** — any inner handler that called `preventDefault()` on `dragover` or `drop` is signalling ownership per the HTML5 drag-and-drop contract. The forwarder yields. Third-party plugin drop zones (e.g. "Administrador de archivos WP") that already work in classic admin keep working untouched inside OpenStation iframes — no opt-in required.

Only drops where neither bail fires (the empty page background, or an inner handler that never called `preventDefault()`) escalate to the shell.

### Drag-hover heartbeat — `os-drag-hover`

Native drag events don't cross iframe boundaries, so when the user holds any drag (an OS file, an image lifted off another admin page, a text selection) over an iframe window, the parent shell can't see the hover. Both bridges (inline chromeless + standalone) forward a throttled heartbeat while `dragover` fires inside the iframe, so the shell's focus-on-drag-hover module can raise the hovered window after its ~250 ms dwell (see the `os.window.focus-on-drag-hover` filter in `javascript-reference.md`).

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-drag-hover` | iframe → parent | `{ payloadType: 'os-file' \| 'external' }` | "A drag is currently hovering me." Throttled to one message per 150 ms. Purely observational — the forwarder never calls `preventDefault()` and carries no coordinates or payload data; the parent resolves the hovered window from `MessageEvent.source` (the sender iframe **is** the hovered window). The parent resets its hover state when heartbeats stop (~1 s watchdog), so no end message exists or is needed. |

### Pointer forwarder — `os-pointer-*`

Pointer events don't cross iframe boundaries either, so the shell goes blind to the cursor the moment it enters a window. Anything shell-side that needs the *real* cursor position while it's over window content — today, Mio's gaze ([`mio.md`](./mio.md#looking-at-the-pointer-across-iframes)) — arms the iframe and rebases what comes back through the iframe element's bounding rect.

Unlike the drag-hover heartbeat, this one is **opt-in**. It runs on every mouse move, so a shell with no consumer must not pay for it: the forwarder installs a no-op listener that returns immediately until the parent enables it.

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-pointer-track` | parent → iframe | `{ enabled: boolean }` | Arm / disarm. Broadcast to every live iframe when the first consumer starts, re-sent to any frame that announces `os-bridge-ready` (so a frame re-arms after every navigation), and broadcast with `enabled: false` when the last consumer tears down. |
| `os-pointer-move` | iframe → parent | `{ x: number, y: number }` | The cursor in the iframe's own client coordinates. Throttled to one message per 40 ms (~25 Hz); the consumer interpolates. Coordinates only — no target element, no event object, nothing about the page content. Passive capture-phase listener; never calls `preventDefault()`. |

Both bridges install the forwarder behind the shared `__openStationPointerForwarderInstalled` sentinel, so a page carrying the inline chromeless bridge *and* the standalone bundle only forwards once.

Parent side: the consumer resolves the sending frame by matching `MessageEvent.source` against each `<iframe>`'s `contentWindow` (cached in a `WeakMap`), then adds that element's `left` / `top`. A message from a frame it can't resolve is dropped rather than guessed at.

### Pre-close unsaved-changes query — `os-bridge-beforeunload-*`

Before tearing down an iframe-backed (non-native) window, `Window.close()` gives the page inside a chance to veto — the same protection a real browser tab close gets from the page's `beforeunload` handler, which a same-origin admin iframe never triggers on its own (there's no real navigation happening).

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-bridge-beforeunload-query` | parent → iframe | *(none)* | Sent once `close()` is called on a window whose bridge has announced readiness (`os-ready` already fired). |
| `os-bridge-beforeunload-response` | iframe → parent | `{ prevent: boolean, message?: string }` | Reply. `prevent: true` means the iframe's own `beforeunload` handling (`window.onbeforeunload` or an `addEventListener('beforeunload', …)` listener) set a message or called `preventDefault()`. |

Flow:

1. `close()` checks `win._iframeBridgeReady` — a window whose iframe never announced readiness (still loading, or a non-openstation page) skips the query entirely and destroys immediately, same as before this feature existed.
2. Otherwise it posts the query, sets `win._closePending = true`, and returns **without** destroying — a 500ms safety timer (`win._iframeCloseTimeout`) forces the close through if no response arrives (a hung or unresponsive iframe can't block closing forever).
3. Both bridge implementations (the inline PHP script in `includes/render/chromeless-bridge.php` and the standalone `src/iframe-bridge-standalone.ts`) answer the query the same way: synthesize a `beforeunload` `Event`, invoke `window.onbeforeunload` with it if set, then (if not already prevented) dispatch a real `beforeunload` event so `addEventListener('beforeunload', …)` listeners run too. Whichever mechanism sets `event.returnValue` or calls `preventDefault()` flips `prevent: true`, carrying the handler's message string through if one was set.
4. On the parent side, `prevent: false` destroys the window immediately. `prevent: true` shows a `<os-confirm-dialog>` (title = the iframe's message, or a generic fallback) — the window is only destroyed if the user confirms.

Native windows are untouched — they still use the synchronous `os.native-window.before-close` filter (see [`javascript-reference.md`](./javascript-reference.md#native-window-lifecycle)), not this postMessage round-trip.

### Editor-autosave query — `os-editor-autosave-*`

When the user clicks an editor window's **Preview (eye)** title-bar button, the shell asks the editor page to autosave — the same thing Gutenberg's own Preview button does — while the companion window opens in parallel; a save that actually landed silently refreshes the companion, so the preview reflects on-screen content even when its first load raced the save. Deliberately **not** named `os-bridge-*`: that prefix is routed into the connection-bridge registry; this is a standalone request/response pair.

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-editor-autosave-request` | parent → iframe | `{ requestId: string }` | "Autosave whatever you're editing, then answer." Sent by `src/editor-preview/autosave.ts` with a 10 s parent-side timeout. |
| `os-editor-autosave-response` | iframe → parent | `{ requestId, status: 'saved' \| 'no-editor' \| 'not-dirty' \| 'error', previewUrl?: string }` | Reply, correlated by `requestId`. `previewUrl` is only present on the Gutenberg save-for-preview path, and only when same-origin. |

The answerer lives in the standalone bridge only (`installEditorAutosaveHandler()` in `src/iframe-bridge-standalone.ts` — installed on every admin page for OpenStation users, chromeless included, outside the bundle's double-install guard so it runs even where the inline chromeless bridge owns `wp.os.iframe`). Editor detection, in order:

1. **Gutenberg** (`wp.data.select( 'core/editor' )` resolves) — prefers `dispatch( 'core/editor' ).__unstableSaveForPreview()`, exactly what core's Preview button calls: it autosaves when needed and resolves to the freshest preview link, returned as `previewUrl`. Fallback when that action is absent: `isEditedPostAutosaveable()` false → `not-dirty` immediately; otherwise `autosave()` watched to completion via `wp.data.subscribe` (8 s best-effort backstop answers `saved` anyway).
2. **Classic editor** (`wp.autosave.server`) — `triggerSave()` + jQuery's `after-autosave` event, with a 5 s backstop that answers **`not-dirty`**, not `saved`. Core's `save()` returns early when `compareString === lastCompareString`: no request goes out and `after-autosave` never fires, so a silent 5 s is core declining to autosave rather than a save it forgot to announce. Answering `saved` there made the shell refresh the preview companion ~5.4 s after the eye click for a save that never happened — late enough to read as a reaction to whatever the user clicked next. A save genuinely still in flight at 5 s is not lost: the live watch's own `after-autosave` handler announces it when it lands. Only when jQuery is absent — unreachable in practice, since `autosave.js` depends on it — does the backstop assume `saved`, because nothing can observe the round-trip there.
3. **Neither** — `no-editor`, immediately, so the parent never waits on a page with nothing to save.

On the parent side every non-`saved` outcome degrades gracefully: the preview opens at the identity's server-computed `previewUrl` (the last saved/autosaved revision), with a warning toast only on `error`.

**Live-preview watch** — while the preview companion is open, the shell also asks the editor page to watch its own content, because typing detection can only live iframe-side (keystrokes never cross the frame boundary):

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-editor-live-watch` | parent → iframe | `{ watchId: string, debounceMs: number }` | Start watching. `debounceMs` (clamped 500–30000) is the settle window after the last edit. A re-watch with the same `watchId` replaces the previous watch. |
| `os-editor-live-unwatch` | parent → iframe | `{ watchId: string }` | Stop watching (sent on pairing teardown; best-effort — the watch dies with the page anyway). |
| `os-editor-live-saved` | iframe → parent | `{ watchId: string, previewUrl?: string }` | "The editor settled and autosaved — refresh the preview." `previewUrl` as in the autosave response. |

Gutenberg watch mechanics: `wp.data.subscribe` + **reference** comparison of `core/block-editor`'s block list and the edited title (every real edit replaces those references). A completing save ALSO churns those references (the save response normalizes the entity and resyncs the block list), and drafts autosave in place — Gutenberg considers them forever autosaveable — so without guards the watcher's own save reads as a fresh edit and loops. Three guards break the feedback: (1) churn arriving while `isSavingPost()`/`isAutosavingPost()` is true — and on the settle tick right after — is absorbed into the baseline without scheduling; (2) a reference change only schedules while `isEditedPostDirty()` (user edits set dirty synchronously; a draft's completed in-place autosave clears it); (3) the settle itself bails when `isEditedPostAutosaveable()` is false (published posts stay dirty relative to published content after an autosave revision — nothing new to save, nothing to refresh). On settle it also defers while a save is in flight (1 s retry), then autosaves via `__unstableSaveForPreview()`.

Classic-editor watch mechanics: no reactive store, so typing is detected on the raw surfaces — `input` on the `#title` / `#content` / `#excerpt` fields (the three classic autosave snapshots) plus edit events on every TinyMCE editor, including editors initialized later (a visual↔text switch re-initializes). On settle the watcher forces the server autosave core would otherwise only run on its ~60 s heartbeat (`wp.autosave.server.triggerSave()`). Core silently drops a trigger while an autosave round-trip is on the wire, so the watcher tracks in-flight state via the `before-autosave`/`after-autosave` events and retries a settle that landed mid-save.

Both the settle and the announcement are gated on a **content fingerprint** — the title input plus, for the body and the excerpt, `tinymce.get( field ).getContent()` (falling back to the raw textarea in text mode or with no TinyMCE). Neither the bound events nor core's own bookkeeping answers "did the user change something":

- **The events don't.** TinyMCE adds an undo level on **blur** and emits `change`, and emits `SetContent` on any programmatic write (init, a visual↔text switch, a plugin normalizing markup). Clicking from the editor into the preview window was enough to schedule a settle.
- **Core's compare string doesn't either.** `wp.autosave.getPostData()` calls `editor.save()` as a side effect, re-serializing the TinyMCE DOM into `#content`. On markup core didn't write (shortcodes, WooCommerce product content, anything `wpautop` round-trips differently) the re-serialized string differs from the stored one, so core's own `compareString !== lastCompareString` gate passes, the autosave goes out, and `after-autosave` fires — for a post the user never touched. This is why the fingerprint must NOT be built from `getPostData()`: doing so inherits exactly that side effect and can never catch the case.

`getContent()` is the stable read — it serializes the same DOM every time, so an idle blur/focus cycle produces an identical string and only a real edit moves it. It is read-only by contract: a fingerprint with a side effect is the bug it exists to prevent.

So: a settle whose fingerprint matches the last announcement sends nothing, and a completed round-trip whose fingerprint matches the last announcement stays silent. The fingerprint is captured at **send** time (`before-autosave`), so an edit typed during the round-trip still counts as unannounced and gets its own save. A screen with none of the three fields fails open.

Two further rules, both needed for the **first** round-trip of a session:

- **An announcement additionally requires an observed edit event since the last one.** The baseline is seeded when the watch starts, which is *before* core has ever called `getPostData()` on that page — and that call's `editor.save()` fires `SaveContent` / `PostProcess`, which WordPress's own `wpview` and wpautop handlers use to rewrite the editor DOM. The first autosave of a session therefore serializes differently from the seed through no user action at all. Every completed round-trip re-baselines the fingerprint whether or not it announced, so that drift is absorbed once and never looked at again.

Every other completed round-trip — forced or core's own — announces `os-editor-live-saved`.

The watch dies with the page (it's plain JS in the iframe), so the shell **re-arms it under a fresh `watchId` on every readiness re-announcement** while the pairing holds — the classic editor reloads on every manual save, and without the re-arm the typing-driven refresh would be permanently dead from that point. The previous `watchId` is unwatched first, so a readiness re-announcement without a real reload never stacks two watches.

### Session re-auth nudge — `os-reauth-detected`

Every chromeless iframe runs its own Heartbeat, and each heartbeat response carries core's `wp-auth-check` boolean (attached server-side, independent of whether the modal JS is loaded — chromeless iframes have the modal suppressed so the parent shell owns the single login prompt). When an iframe's heartbeat sees the flag flip `false → true` — the user re-authenticated somewhere — the bridge nudges the parent before reloading itself, so the shell's recovery (`src/auth-recovery/index.ts`) starts immediately instead of waiting out the parent's own heartbeat schedule.

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-reauth-detected` | iframe → parent | *(none)* | "My heartbeat just saw the session come back." The parent forces a tick of its own (fresh nonces ride it), sweeps a reload over the other iframes, and fires `os-auth-restored` (see [`javascript-reference.md`](./javascript-reference.md#session-expiry--recovery-stable)). Recovery is cooldown-gated, so the one-message-per-open-window fan-in collapses into a single run. |

## Lifecycle walkthrough — parent-initiated connection

1. **Plugin calls** `wp.os.connect( 'edit-post', { topics: [ 'gutenberg:content' ] } )`.
2. Connection bridge mints a `connectionId` (`os-conn-N`), stores the connection in `_connections`, indexes it by target window in `_connectionsByTarget`.
3. Bridge looks up the iframe via `_syntheticIframes.get( id ) ?? manager.getById( id )?.iframe`.
4. Bridge `postMessage`s `os-bridge-handshake` to the iframe's `contentWindow` with `targetOrigin = INITIAL_ORIGIN`.
5. Plugin code calls `conn.send( 'foo', payload )` before the ack arrives — message goes into the connection's `queue`, no `postMessage` yet.
6. Iframe's bridge handler receives the handshake, stores the connection in its own `connections` map, posts `os-bridge-handshake-ack` back.
7. Parent's `routeIncomingFromIframe` receives the ack, dispatches to the connection's `_handleIframeMessage`, which:
   - Sets `isOpen = true`.
   - Fires `HOOKS.CONNECTION_OPENED` with `{ connectionId, targetWindowId, topics, connection }`. The `connection` field is the live `WindowConnection` — plug in `.subscribe()` directly from the hook handler without an extra `wp.os.getConnection(id)` round-trip.
   - Calls `opts.onOpen?.()`.
   - Drains the queue with `flushQueue()` — every queued message becomes a real `postMessage`.
8. Iframe receives the publishes, looks up subscribers in `subs`, calls each in turn.

## Lifecycle walkthrough — iframe-initiated connection (`requestConnection`)

1. Iframe-side calls `wp.os.iframe.requestConnection({ topics: [ 'wpglp:content' ] })`.
2. Iframe bridge mints a `requestId`, registers a one-shot ack listener with a 5-second timeout, posts `os-bridge-connection-request` to the parent.
3. Parent's `handleWindowMessage` (or the `iframeContent` synthesised render's listener) sees the bridge-prefixed message, calls `routeIncomingFromIframe( data, win.id )`.
4. `routeIncomingFromIframe` recognises `connection-request` and calls `handleConnectionRequest( windowId, requestId, topics )`.
5. The shell runs `applyFilters( HOOKS.IFRAME_CONNECTION_REQUEST, true, { windowId, requestId, topics } )`. Default value is `true` (accept). Plugin code can return `false` to reject, or `{ topics: [ ... ] }` to accept while narrowing.
6. On accept, `connect( windowId, { topics: finalTopics } )` opens a parent-side connection. The parent then posts `os-bridge-connection-ack { requestId, accepted: true, connectionId }` back.
7. Iframe's ack listener resolves the original `requestConnection()` promise with `{ id, topics }` and calls `opts.onOpen?.()`.
8. The handshake completes normally between this new connection and the iframe (the iframe's existing `os-bridge-handshake` listener picks it up and acks).

## How the synthesised iframe inside a native window joins the bridge

A native window registered via `wp.os.registerWindow({ iframeContent })` is special: `Window.iframe` is `null` (only chromeless wp-admin pages set that), but the body contains a real `<iframe>` the shell created.

`buildIframeContentRender`:

1. Creates the `<iframe>`.
2. Calls `registerSyntheticIframe( windowId, iframe )` — adds an entry to `_syntheticIframes` so the connection bridge's iframe lookup finds it.
3. Installs a `message` listener that:
   - Validates `event.source === iframe.contentWindow` and `event.origin` matches the iframe URL's origin.
   - Forwards bridge-prefixed messages (`os-bridge-*`) to `routeIncomingFromIframe( data, windowId )` so the iframe can participate in `connect()` traffic.
   - Forwards every message (bridge or not) to `cfg.onMessage?.()` so plugins that want raw access still get it.
4. On window close, the cleanup chain (passed through `onClose`) calls `unregisterSynth()` and removes the `message` listener, so closed windows don't leak.

`windowId` throughout is the **live instance id**, resolved from the window root (`id="wp-window-<windowId>"`) the render callback mounts into — not the id passed to `registerWindow()`. The two differ whenever `manager.open()` allocates a suffixed instance (`chat` → `chat-2`, e.g. opening the same registered window on a second virtual desktop). Anything keying off the registered id would attach the second instance's iframe, readiness signal, and channel dispatch to the first instance.

## Admin link routing inside chromeless iframes

The chromeless bridge intercepts every same-origin `<a href="/wp-admin/…">` click inside an iframe and lets the parent shell decide where the navigation should actually land. The decision lives in the parent because the iframe doesn't know the shell's window slug rules (which query params are identity-bearing, which URLs are remapped to a native window, which already-open window owns the destination, and so on).

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-iframe-admin-link` | iframe → parent | `{ url, label, newContext }` | Posted from the chromeless bridge's link interceptor for every admin-internal click that survived the modifier-key / target / download filters. `label` is the clicked link's visible text (falling back to its `title` / `aria-label`, truncated to 80 chars). `newContext` is true when the link named another browsing context, and bars the parent from driving the source window with it. The bridge `preventDefault`s the click first; the parent owns the navigation. |

Parent dispatch (in `src/window/iframe-bridge.ts`, wired by `bindAdminLinkDispatch` in `desktop.ts`):

1. **Native-window remap** — the URL goes through `tryNativeUrlRemap`. On a hit the parent opens the native window and closes the source iframe so the brief in-flight nav never paints.
2. **Same-slug click** — `deriveWindowId(url, adminUrl)` matches the source window's `baseId` **or** the slug its iframe is currently showing (`getCurrentUrl()`). The parent calls `iframe.contentWindow.location.assign(url)`, which navigates the iframe in place AND adds a session-history entry. Pagination, list filtering, and per-window tab strips ride this path.

   Both slugs count because they diverge as soon as the iframe navigates in place: clicking the Menus tab in the Appearance window points the iframe at `nav-menus.php` while the window keeps `baseId: themes-php`. Matching only `baseId` would classify the Menus screen's own tab links as cross-page and spawn a fresh window per click. The live slug only ever *widens* the same-page set — it never turns an in-place navigation into a new window, so a window that has navigated away still treats a link back to its landing page as in-page.
3. **Cross-slug click** — slug matches neither the source window's `baseId` nor its live URL. The parent calls `windowManager.open({ id, baseId, url, title, icon })` with title/icon copied from the matching dock entry. When no dock tile owns the destination, the title falls back to the `label` from the message (the clicked link's visible text), then to the derived slug as a last resort. The source iframe is left untouched, so the user keeps both contexts. When a window for the destination slug is *already open*, `open()`'s URL-aware reuse applies: if the clicked URL isn't what that window is showing (nor its home / dock landing URL), the existing window's iframe navigates to it in place — so an action URL like the post-install `plugins.php?action=activate&plugin=…&_wpnonce=…` link actually runs instead of being dropped by a bare focus.

Modifier-key clicks (cmd / ctrl / shift / alt, middle-click) and links carrying a `download` attribute short-circuit the bridge's interceptor entirely — the browser's native open-in-new-tab / save path runs unchanged.

A `target` is read the same way, with one exception. `target="_blank"` on a same-origin `/wp-admin/` URL means "open this admin screen without losing the one I'm on", and inside the shell that is another OpenStation window rather than a bare browser tab — so those links are claimed like any other admin link and reach the parent as `os-iframe-admin-link`, carrying `newContext: true`. That flag bars both in-place branches above: the one thing a `_blank` asks for is that the page it was clicked on survives, and moving that window is worse than the browser tab it used to get. The case that forced this: the block editor's revisions sidebar renders **Open classic revisions screen** (`revision.php?revision=N`) through `<ExternalLink>`, which hard-codes `target="_blank"`, so the click ejected the user into a chrome-free wp-admin tab — and under the PWA that tab is inside the app's own scope, so it relaunched the whole app.

Only when the destination is a **different wp-admin file**, though. Whether two URLs on the same file are the same "page" is a question about the slug rules above, and the iframe has no access to those, so a `_blank` to `admin.php?page=x&tab=b` from `admin.php?page=x` keeps opening a browser tab. Fewer of these become windows than could, and none of them can eat the page underneath.

Every other target still yields to the browser: `_top` / `_parent` are a deliberate "replace the whole shell" and are a page's only escape hatch, a named target (`wp-preview-4`) is an author reusing one specific tab across clicks which a window can't honour, and any target on a non-admin URL is a real new tab with no window to open into.

Anchors carrying core's `aria-button-if-js` class are left alone. That class is core's marker for "this anchor is really an in-page button, the href is only the no-JS fallback", and the script that owns the button (media-grid.js, wp-lists, tags.js, updates.js) `preventDefault`s it in bubble phase. Since the bridge's interceptor is capture-phase it would otherwise win the race and hand the user the fallback URL: on the Media Library grid, clicking **Add Media File** opened a window for `media-new.php` while media-grid.js expanded the inline uploader in the Media window behind it.

The class doesn't promise a handler, though. The Media list table stamps it on Trash / Restore / Delete Permanently (`.submitdelete`) and binds nothing, so the href really is the navigation. Those still get yielded, but the interceptor first rewrites the href to carry `_wp_http_referer=<this page>`, the iframe-side twin of the parent's `stampSourceReferer()`, which no longer sees these clicks. Without it, a `Referrer-Policy` of `strict-origin` or tighter downgrades the `Referer` to the bare origin, `post.php` matches it against neither `post.php` nor `post-new.php`, and the post-delete redirect lands on the site front page inside the window instead of back on the media list. The destination keeps rendering chromeless via the `Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe` fallback in `openstation_is_chromeless_request()`.

Links owned by core's `wp-admin/js/updates.js` are also left alone: the card-style `install-now` / `update-link` / `update-now` / `delete-plugin` / `delete-theme` / `install-theme` buttons, the plugins-list-table row Delete (`[data-plugin] a.delete`), and the network themes row Delete (`.themes-php.network-admin a.delete`). updates.js `preventDefault`s these itself and runs an in-place AJAX operation; if the bridge hijacked them, the parent-driven navigation would race the AJAX call (a `wp.updates.beforeunload` "Leave site?" prompt followed by the no-JS fallback screen for an already-deleted plugin).

The Dashboard's welcome panel is the same story with no marker class at all: `dashboard.js` binds the dismiss on the anchor and `preventDefault`s it, and `?welcome=0` is a dead no-JS fallback. The interceptor yields `.welcome-panel-close` and `.welcome-panel-dismiss a` inside `#welcome-panel`, matching core's own selector. Routing them opened a second Dashboard window titled **Dismiss** on top of the one being dismissed.

Forms submit through a separate `submit` listener that only rewrites the action URL (to keep `openstation_chromeless=1`) and never `preventDefault`s. Same-origin form posts to a different page would currently navigate the iframe in place; if that becomes a UX problem it can join this protocol as a `os-iframe-admin-form-submit` message.

### Window titles the shell had to guess

`label` is the link's **visible** text: `.screen-reader-text` / `.hidden` descendants are dropped and whitespace is collapsed before it ships. Core routinely pairs a terse visible label with a longer screen-reader one inside a single anchor — the classic post editor's revisions link is `<span aria-hidden="true">Browse</span><span class="screen-reader-text">Browse revisions</span>` — and reading the whole `textContent` titled its window "Browse Browse revisions".

A label is still only a guess. When no dock tile owns the destination, the parent opens the window with `titleFromPage`, and the window replaces the guess with the destination page's own screen name (`document.title` up to WP's ` ‹ ` separator) on every iframe load. Link text is written for someone already looking at the page it sits on, so it reads badly as a window name: "Browse" says nothing about revisions, while the page calls itself "Revisions". A locale that re-punctuates admin-header's title format falls through to the whole document title rather than being cut in the wrong place, and an `os-title-change` from the iframe still wins over both.

### Screens that hand off when they're done

A window opened on `revision.php` closes itself when its iframe leaves that screen, and its destination goes through the routing above — so the editor window the user opened Revisions *from* is focused and pointed at the restored post, rather than the Revisions window quietly becoming a second, and the original staying stale.

Restoring a revision is a `document.location` assignment in `wp-admin/js/revisions.js`, so no click ever reaches the bridge; WP's redirect just lands wherever the frame happens to be. The URL forwarded is the one navigation timing recorded, not `location.href` — `wp-admin/js/common.js` strips WP's removable query args (`message`, `settings-updated`, …) via `replaceState` on DOM ready, which is *before* the parent's `load` listener runs, and `message=5` is what renders the "Post restored to revision from …" notice.

This is deliberately a short list (`HANDOFF_SCREENS` in `src/window/iframe-bridge.ts`) and not a general "any window that crosses slugs hands off" rule: the submenu tab strip re-points windows across slugs on purpose (Appearance → Menus), and closing a window out from under that click would be hostile. A screen belongs here only when leaving it means the screen is finished.

## Activity-footprint launcher inside chromeless iframes — Stable

The classic Users list table (`users.php`, rendered as a chromeless iframe) grows a **"View activity footprint"** row action — added server-side by `openstation_user_footprint_row_action` (see [`hooks-reference.md`](hooks-reference.md)). Clicking it opens the target user's GitHub-style activity footprint inside the pinned **WP Explorer** native window, *without* closing the Users list.

This deliberately does NOT reuse the admin-link path above: that path closes the source iframe on a native-window remap hit (it models a navigation *away*). A row action is an auxiliary *peek*, so it gets its own message.

**Carrier contract.** The row-action link declares the target on the anchor itself:

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| `data-os-footprint` | Target user id (positive integer). **Required** — its presence is what the bridge sniffs. |
| `data-os-footprint-name` | Display name, used to seed the footprint breadcrumb before the REST payload resolves. Optional. |
| `href` | A real `user-edit.php?user_id=N` / `profile.php` URL — the graceful fallback followed only when JS is off or on a modifier / middle click. |

| Type | Direction | Carries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os-open-user-footprint` | iframe → parent | `{ userId: number, userName: string }` | Posted from the chromeless bridge when a `[data-os-footprint]` link is clicked (checked *before* the admin-link classifier, so the fallback `href` is never followed inside the shell). The parent opens / focuses the WP Explorer window on that user's footprint route and leaves the source window open. |

**Parent dispatch** (`src/window/iframe-bridge.ts`): calls `openUserFootprintWindow( { userId, userName } )` (`src/my-wordpress/footprint-target.ts`), which stashes the target in the `desktop-mode/my-wordpress/footprint-target` shared store, then opens the window via `wp.os.openWindow`. Cold-start safe: the WP Explorer bundle reads the target on mount and subscribes for re-targets while it's already open. See [`javascript-reference.md`](javascript-reference.md) for the public `wp.os.myWordpress.openUserFootprint`.

## Top-frame escape hatch — and how to opt out

The inline chromeless bridge runs one check before anything else: is
this page the top frame? A chromeless page is meant to live inside a
window iframe, so a top-level one is normally an accident — a stale
bookmark, a bad portal redirect — and the page has no admin bar, which
means no way to turn OpenStation off. The bridge rescues it: strip
`openstation_chromeless`, strip `desktop_mode_portal`, and
`location.replace()` into classic admin.

An embedder that hosts a top-level chromeless page **on purpose** opts
out by setting a global before the page's own scripts run:

```js
window.openStationChromelessHost = true;
```

The bridge then leaves the URL alone. It still returns early — every
feature below the check posts to `window.parent`, and there isn't one —
so a hosted chromeless page gets a plain admin screen and nothing else.

The native desktop host (`extensions/openstation-electron-adapter`)
sets it from the preload of every window a user sets free. It has to be
a JS global rather than a query flag: a flag is lost on the first
in-page navigation, and the rescue would fire the moment the user
clicked a link inside their own window.

## Public hooks

| Hook | Kind | Status | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `os.connection.opened` | action | Experimental | `{ connectionId, targetWindowId, topics, connection? }` — `connection` (the live `WindowConnection`) is present for iframe-target opens; native-target opens currently omit it |
| `os.connection.closed` | action | Experimental | `{ connectionId, reason: 'disconnect' \| 'window-closed' \| 'navigated' }` — `'navigated'` is reserved in the type union; no code path emits it yet, so today only the first two are observed |
| `os.connection.message` | action | Experimental | `{ connectionId, topic, direction: 'in' \| 'out' }` — high-volume, keep subscribers cheap |
| `os.iframe.connection-request` | filter | Experimental | `boolean \| { topics: string[] } ← (accept, ctx)` — return `false` to reject, an object to accept-with-narrowing |

## Internal sniff points

When something's not working:

- **`window.__openStationConnectionBridge`** — installed by `desktop.ts` on init. If it's `undefined` in DevTools, the shell hasn't booted yet (or you're in a frame that's not the parent shell).
- **`window.wp.os.iframe`** — the iframe-side API. If it's `undefined` inside an iframe, the bridge script wasn't loaded — for chromeless wp-admin pages it's inline; for `iframeContent: { bridge: true }` it's auto-injected after load; for any other same-origin iframe enqueue `os-iframe-bridge`.
- **`window.location.origin`** check — every postMessage in both directions filters on this. A common cause of "messages don't arrive" is a shell mounted on `https://example.test` and an iframe loaded from `http://example.test` (different origin); same domain ≠ same origin.
- **`event.source === iframe.contentWindow`** check — even same-origin, a foreign caller posting `os-bridge-*` messages from somewhere ELSE in the parent will be silently dropped.

## Cross-origin iframes — explicit non-goal

**Every bridge listener in this repo validates `event.origin`**, and three of the four are strictly same-origin:

- `src/iframe-bridge-standalone.ts` — `parentOrigin = window.location.origin`.
- `src/connection/index.ts` — `INITIAL_ORIGIN = window.location.origin`.
- `src/drag-bridge.ts` — `this._origin = window.location.origin`.

The fourth listener — `src/native-windows.ts`'s `iframeContent` message handler — validates against the iframe URL's *resolved* origin (falling back to the shell origin for relative / invalid URLs) and forwards `os-bridge-*` messages into the connection registry. A native window configured with a cross-origin `iframeContent.url` therefore grants that foreign origin bridge access for that window: only point `iframeContent.url` at origins you trust.

Each postMessage's `targetOrigin` is set to its own captured origin, and each `'message'` listener rejects events whose `e.origin` doesn't match. Cross-origin parents silently drop every bridge message — no warn, no fallback. This is **deliberate**: the bridge payloads feed into drop handlers that insert HTML and into hook subscribers that may execute code, so widening the trust boundary would create a clear XSS surface.

Concretely, the bridge will not operate in these contexts:

- **Cross-origin parent** — OpenStation loaded in an `<iframe>` whose parent is on a different origin (top-level admin opened outside the shell, or shell embedded in a foreign host).
- **Foreign-origin Gutenberg `srcdoc` canvas** — by default the editor-canvas iframe inherits the parent's origin (works fine), but some plugin / theme combos override `src` to a foreign URL.
- **Sandboxed iframes** (`<iframe sandbox>` without `allow-same-origin`) — the iframe's origin is `"null"`, which never matches.
- **PWA wrappers** loading OpenStation in a foreign service-worker scope.

### Detecting it from inside an iframe

`wp.os.iframe.isParentReachable()` returns `true` when the parent is same-origin and addressable, `false` otherwise:

```javascript
if ( ! wp.os.iframe.isParentReachable() ) {
    // No bridge — fall back to in-iframe UI, skip the feature,
    // or surface a "this view requires OpenStation" notice.
    return;
}
// Bridge is live; publish away.
wp.os.iframe.publish( 'editor:content', html );
```

The predicate accesses `window.parent.location.origin` inside a try/catch — cross-origin parents throw on the access. Cheap, no postMessage round-trip. Use it before wiring expensive subscriptions or showing UI that promises cross-window behavior.

## Cross-window drag bridge — Stable

A separate channel from the connection bridge. Where the connection bridge carries app-level pub/sub between a window and its iframe, the **drag bridge** carries an in-flight drag payload between the parent shell and ALL same-origin iframes — receivers don't need to be "connected" to receive it.

### When it fires

The drag bridge stores a single `DragBridgePayload` at any given time. Two ways the payload gets in:

- **Shell-side drag source** — a DragManager `'shortcut'` or `'desktop-file'` session whose payload carries `data.bridgePayload` starts (a shell-rendered tile from WP Explorer media / post / user, or an existing wallpaper placement dragged off the desktop). The shell's `DRAG_EVENTS.START` listener (`src/desktop.ts`) reads `payload.data.bridgePayload` and calls `dragBridge.start(payload)`. Cleared on `DRAG_EVENTS.END`.
- **Iframe-side drag source** — an iframe postMessages `{ type: 'os-drag-start', payload }` to the parent. The bridge stores the payload and broadcasts `DRAG_BRIDGE_EVENTS.START` as a `CustomEvent` on `document` so other shell modules can react.

### Receiver protocol

Drop-receiver iframes have two ways to consume the payload:

1. **Push** — `src/drag/iframe-drop-targets.ts` suppresses `pointer-events` on every iframe window for the drag's duration and registers each window body as a drop target. When the pointer is over an iframe window and the gesture is a `'shortcut'` or `'desktop-file'` drag carrying a `bridgePayload`, the shell postMessages:

   | Message | Direction | Payload |
   |---|---|---|
   | `os-drag-over` | parent → iframe | `{ type, payload: DragBridgePayload }` |
   | `os-drag-leave` | parent → iframe | `{ type }` |
   | `os-drop` | parent → iframe | `{ type, payload: DragBridgePayload, position: { x, y } }` |

   Receivers listen on `window.message`, check `event.origin === window.location.origin`, and switch on `data.payload.kind`. The built-in Gutenberg receiver (`src/gutenberg-drop-receiver.ts`) is the canonical example.

2. **Pull** — any iframe can postMessage `{ type: 'os-drag-payload-request' }` and the parent replies (directly to `event.source`) with `{ type: 'os-drag-payload', payload }`. Useful for iframes that bind their own native `drop` handler and need the rich payload after the browser has stripped the custom MIME from DataTransfer.

### Payload union

```ts
type DragBridgePayload =
  | { kind: 'attachment'; id: number; url: string; title: string;
      alt: string; mime: string; thumbnailUrl?: string;
      sizes?: Record<string, unknown> }
  | { kind: 'post'; id: number; postType: string; url: string;
      title: string }
  | { kind: 'user'; id: number; url: string; title: string };
```

### Sniff points

- **`document.body[data-os-dragging]`** — set by the DragManager while ANY drag is in flight. Pair with `[data-os-drag-type="shortcut"]` to gate drag-state CSS in the shell.
- **`window.wp.os.dragBridge.getPayload()`** — read the current cross-frame payload from anywhere in the parent shell.
- **`os-cross-frame-drag-start` / `-end` CustomEvents** — dispatched on `document` each time the bridge transitions. Plugins layer drop-zone highlights on these without polling.

## Don't reinvent the wiring

If you find yourself writing `window.parent.postMessage` or hand-rolling a handshake, check first:

- For shell-registered iframe windows (chromeless wp-admin) → use `wp.os.connect()` + `wp.os.iframe.publish/subscribe`.
- For your own iframe pages → enqueue `os-iframe-bridge` OR set `iframeContent: { bridge: true }` on a native window.
- For iframe-initiated requests → `wp.os.iframe.requestConnection()`.
- For source-validation + load-vs-listener-race → `wp.os.registerWindow({ iframeContent: { bridge: true, onMessage } })` — `onMessage` is pre-validated against the iframe's `contentWindow`, and readiness needs no callback: `Window.send` payloads queue and flush automatically once the iframe loads (`HOOKS.IFRAME_READY` fires for observers).

The whole "shell.js coordinator" pattern is gone if you reach for these. The plugin's parent-shell footprint goes from ~150 lines of postMessage plumbing to a ~5-line config object.
