# Register a desktop theme from a plugin

**Status:** Experimental

A [desktop theme](../desktop-themes.md) reskins the whole shell. Site
admins normally install one by uploading a ZIP in OpenStation Preferences →
Themes, but a plugin can ship one directly — same sanitizer, same
compiler, same constraints. The only difference is that your assets
are absolute URLs you already serve instead of files inside an archive.

> Not the same as `openstation_register_window_theme()`, which
> restyles **one window's** chrome. This restyles the entire OS.

Drop your images under `theme/` next to the plugin file and you're
done. The theme appears in OpenStation Preferences → Themes for every user on the
site the moment the plugin activates — no reload, because the
`serverDesktopThemes` payload rides the existing live-refresh channel.

---

## What you get for free

- **Live activation and deactivation.** Activating your plugin makes
  the theme appear in every open shell. Deactivating removes it, and
  any user currently wearing it falls back to the system default
  without a reload.
- **Sanitization.** Your manifest travels the same validator an
  uploaded ZIP does. If a value doesn't apply, check it against the
  [value grammar](../desktop-themes.md#value-grammar) — the most common
  causes are a `url()` (PHP generates those for you) or a `var()`.
- **Slug precedence.** If a site admin has uploaded a theme with the
  same slug, theirs wins. Namespace your id (`acme/neon-glass`) and
  this won't come up.

---

## Reacting to the active theme

Plugins that paint their own chrome can follow along:

```js
// Repaint when the user switches themes. Fires only on a real change.
document.addEventListener( 'os-desktop-theme-changed', ( e ) => {
    const { themeId, previous } = e.detail;
    myToolbar.repaint();
} );

// Ask the active theme for an icon. `null` means "no theme, or this
// slot isn't overridden" — paint your default.
const closeIcon = wp.os.desktopThemes.resolveIcon(
    'WINDOW_CONTROL_CLOSE',
);
```

And themes can be extended by other plugins through the icon filter:

```js
wp.hooks.addFilter(
    'os.desktop-theme.icon',
    'my-plugin',
    ( icon, { slot, themeId } ) =>
        slot === 'APP:my-plugin' ? myBrandedIconUrl : icon,
);
```

---

## Gotchas

- **Control glyphs are monochrome.** Window control icons paint as a
  `currentColor`-tinted CSS mask so they keep the title bar's
  focused/unfocused tinting. Only the alpha channel of your image is
  used. Design them as solid silhouettes.
- **`preview` is worth shipping.** Without it the theme card in OS
  Settings falls back to two initials on a grey rectangle.
- **Assets must be reachable.** `plugins_url()` output is validated as
  an `http(s)` URL whose extension is on the allowlist for that kind —
  images for `preview` / `icons` / `textures`, fonts for `fonts`.
  Anything else is dropped. The two lists are disjoint, so pointing a
  `TITLEBAR` texture at a `.woff2` fails silently.
- **A declared font is not a used font.** `fonts` defines faces; the
  typography tokens are what reference them. Declare both or nothing
  changes.
- **Recommendations fire once per user.** `recommendedOsSettings` is
  seeded on a user's first activation of your theme and never
  re-asserted. If you're testing it and nothing happens, you have
  already been seeded — use the **Apply &lt;theme&gt;'s recommended
  layout** button in OpenStation Preferences → Themes, or
  `wp.os.desktopThemes.applyRecommendedOsSettings()`.
- **Licensing is yours.** A bundled font is redistributed to every
  visitor of every site that installs the theme. Ship one whose licence
  permits that.
